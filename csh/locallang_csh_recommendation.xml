			<label index=".description">A recommendation is the content that will be shown to the user once an assessment is completed.  The recommendation that is chosen is based on how the user answers the questions within the assessment.</label>
			<label index="hidden.description">Enabling the Hide field will prevent the assessment recommendation from displaying in the Frontend.</label>
			<label index="type.description">Select whether you want to associate this recommendation record with a category, a question, or the full assessment.</label>
			<label index="min_value.description">The minimum score that will generate this recommendation.</label>
			<label index="max_value.description">The maximum score that will generate this recommendation.</label>
			<label index="max_value.details">Values must overlap in order to ensure all possible average scores will be covered: 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, etc. This is important because if an average score generated at 2.5 and the range of recommendations was 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, then the 2.5 would not trigger a recommendation, since it fell between the 1-2 and the 3-4 range. Tied values (such as an average score of 2 in this example) generate the higher recommendation.</label>
			<label index="text.value">The text of the recommendation. Note that you can include links and images if needed.</label>
